    "Course Description\n",
    "\n",
    "This course will continue our exploration of algorithms and data-structures over trees and graphs. In particular, trees and graphs are used to represent relational data and networks such as computer networks, road networks, biological networks and so on. The course will focus on the following topics:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Binary Search Tree Data Structure and Balanced Binary Search Trees. \n",
    "\n",
    "    Representing Graphs, Graph Traversals and their Applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Spanning Trees over Graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Amortized Analysis and Disjoint Set Data Structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Shortest Path Algorithms over Graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithmic techniques covered are quite fundamental and the student will learn the basic approaches to analyze these algorithms. They will also learn to translate their knowledge into developing python programs for applications.\n",
    "MS-DS Program Learning Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "Successful completion of this course demonstrate your achievement of the following learning outcomes for the MS-DS program:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Acquire, clean, wrangle, and manage data.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Understand the principles of efficient algorithms for dealing with large scale data sets and be able to select appropriate algorithms for specific problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Understand and be able to apply the main computational techniques used to analyze large data sets, including a variety of data mining and machine learning approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Understand the principles of computer representation, storage and access of large data sets and be able to determine the appropriate approaches for specific problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Correctly apply the data science skills above to a specific domain area (e.g., business, climate science).\n",
    "\n",
    "    Clearly communicate the results of a data science analysis to a non-technical audience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Drops, Tuition Refunds, and Withdrawals\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the MS-DS has flexible course start dates, all drops, tuition refunds, withdrawals and grades are handled at the individual course level. It is the student’s responsibility to monitor these deadlines. Coursera and CU Boulder are not responsible for notifying the students of these deadlines. For approximate session timelines, access the Boulder MS-DS Onboarding Course via the MS-DS degree homepage. To drop or withdraw from a course please complete the appropriate form on the CU Boulder Office of the Registrar website\n",

    "Drops and Refunds\n",
    "\n",
    "Each student has 14 days from a class start date or their enrollment date (whichever is later) to request a drop for 100% tuition refund. Students are only eligible to drop a course if they have not accessed the restricted content (timed proctored exam) or received a grade.  When a course is dropped under these conditions, it will not appear on the student’s record.\n",
    "Withdrawal\n",
    "\n",
    "Students who request to drop the course after the 14-day period and who have not accessed the timed proctored assessment may withdraw from the course but will not receive a refund. When a student withdraws from a course under these conditions, the student will receive a grade of W on their academic record. W grades have no bearing on the GPA and credit total.\n",

Professional courtesy and sensitivity are especially important with respect to individuals and topics dealing with race, color, national origin, sex, pregnancy, age, disability, creed, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, veteran status, political affiliation or political philosophy. Class rosters are provided to the instructor with the student's legal name. We will gladly honor your request to address you by an alternate name or gender pronoun. Please advise us of this preference early in the semester so that we may make appropriate changes to my records. For more information, see the policies on classroom behavior\n",

    ". \n",
    "\n",
    "Students who violate the Honor Code are subject to discipline. Violations of the policy may include: plagiarism, cheating, fabrication, lying, bribery, threats, unauthorized access to academic materials, submitting the same or similar work in more than one course without permission from all course instructors involved, and aiding academic dishonesty. Students are specifically expected to turn in original work and cite portions created by other authors. If a student has doubts regarding what collaboration is permissible in the course, the student should consult the discussion forums or the course facilitator directly.\n",
    "Sexual Misconduct, Discrimination, Harassment and/or Related Retaliation\n",
    "\n",
    "CU Boulder is committed to fostering a positive and welcoming learning, working, and living environment. CU Boulder will not tolerate acts of sexual misconduct (including sexual harassment, exploitation, and assault), intimate partner violence (including dating or domestic violence), stalking, protected-class discrimination or harassment by members of our community. Individuals who believe they have been subject to misconduct or retaliatory actions for reporting a concern should contact the Office of Institutional Equity and Compliance (OIEC) at 303-492-2127 or cureport@colorado.edu. Information about the OIEC, university policies, reporting\n",
    " options, and other resources can be found on the OIEC website\n",

    "\n",
    "Please know that faculty and instructors have a responsibility to inform OIEC when made aware of incidents of sexual misconduct, discrimination, harassment and/or related retaliation, to ensure that individuals impacted receive information about reporting options and support resources. This applies regardless of where or when an incident occurs as long as it involves a member of the CU community.\n",
    "Religious Holidays\n",
    "\n",
    "Campus policy regarding religious observances requires that faculty make every effort to deal reasonably and fairly with all students who, because of religious obligations, have conflicts with scheduled exams, assignments or required attendance. Since this is an online class, with no fixed weekly calendar schedule, we ask that you arrange your workload to accommodate your religious practice. See the campus policy regarding religious observances\n",
