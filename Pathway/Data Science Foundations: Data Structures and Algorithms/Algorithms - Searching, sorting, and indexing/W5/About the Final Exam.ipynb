    "# Final Exam Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "### This is a \"take home\" final exam. You have  24 hours to solve them.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- The time limit will not be enforced by Coursera. Instead, we will leave it to the honor code that you will submit the final exam 24 hours after you start.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We reserve the right to go through your final exam and penalize your work if we find evidence that you took more than the given 24 hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you have accommodations, you can take more time as allowed by your accommodations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final is identical to a programming assignment: the problems are algorithmic coding problems that require you to use the concepts you have learned so far to solve problems.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We expect that the problems will cumulatively require 4 - 6 hours of work to finish and the remaining time will provide you the necessary flexibility.\n",
    "Format\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each problem has an algorithm design part: you should write pseudocode and work out the worst/expected case running time for your own benefit.\n",
    "\n",
    "- However, these portions will not be graded.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each problem has a coding portion where you will have to code up your solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The coding portion will be graded against automatic tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "- The exam is open book and notes.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - You may access your own notes and any resources available through the Coursera class website.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - You may access python language documentation and tutorials online.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Your code should be efficient: if you have inefficiency the notebook may not pass all the tests in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - If the notebook does not pass all tests within a time limit (set internally by Cousera's autograder), you will not receive points.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use of external resources other than those sanctioned above is disallowed: \n",
    "\n",
    "    - Asking for help from anyone other than course facilitators is disallowed.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Course facilitators will be able to provide clarifications about problems but no extra hints will be provided. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Posting problems from this exam on external websites/forums is disallowed.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Cutting and pasting code fragments from external sources is prohibited.   \n",
    "\n",
    "    - Searching for solutions online is strictly forbidden.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Please do not post any part of this exam or solutions online.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is highly recommended that you start the exam during a time when a course facilitator is available through email to provide timely clarifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Do not submit until you are ready\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Do not submit the exam until you are fully done. \n",
    "\n",
    "    - Resubmissions may be permitted but not lead to grade changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Useful Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "- Have you understood the problem completely?\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Use pencil and paper to work out examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ask the facilitator for clarifications, if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - This will unfortunately take time.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - There is no guarantee that the facilitator will respond in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Facilitators will not provide hints.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - It may be helpful to arrange the exam around known office hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is helpful to go over each and every problem and have a list of questions for the facilitator.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Plan your time carefully: the provided 24 hours should be plenty of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Get the \"easy\" problems out of the way.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Go through test cases carefully: they can often give you some useful hints.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Drops, Refunds, and Withdrawals\n",
    "\n",
    "You may drop this course with a 100% refund within 14 days of your class start date or your enrollment date (whichever is later) as long as long as you have not accessed restricted content (e.g., password quiz, honor code verification, final exam/project, etc.) or received a grade. When a course is dropped under these conditions, it will not appear on your record.  You can withdraw after the 14 days as long as you have not accessed restricted content or received a grade. When a student withdraws under these conditions, they will receive a grade of W on their academic record.
