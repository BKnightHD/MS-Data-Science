If you prefer to comment on the case where recommender systems suggest political content as discussed by Tufecki, rather than on musical content that is fine too.   \n",

Since you will need your old discussion posts in order to complete the final assignment, we suggest that you save your discussion responses in a separate document so that you will still have access to them should you decide to upgrade your enrollment to the for-credit version of the course. Thank you!"
