    "### Introducing Vilja Hulden\n",
    "\n",
    "Dr. Vilja Hulden is a labor and social historian focusing on the modern United States. Her book manuscript, \"Government by the Bosses: Employers Against Worker Power Before the New Deal\" argues that debates over who should govern at the workplace have crucially shaped American ideas about democratic participation and the relationship between individual rights and collective action. She is also active in digital humanities research and regularly presents her work at digital humanities conferences. Her most recent digital project, called \"Speaking to the State,\"  constructs a computational analysis of representation of labor and business at Congressional hearings since 1877."

    "Dr. Seth Spielman is an Associate Professor of Geography and Information Science at the University of Colorado and a Data Scientist at Apple.  His expertise is at the intersection of maps, statistics, machine learning, and the social sciences. His recently published book on Urban Analytics tries to bring together these diverse fields.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Dr. Spielman has received the Breheny Prize for the best paper in Urban Analytics and City Science, he won a kaggle.com data science competition, and was awarded a distinguished scholar award in Urban Planning from the American Association of Geographers.   The journal  Science profiled him as an archetype of a new generation of data-centric geographers.  His publications have appeared in a diverse set of journals including PNAS, PlosOne, Demography, Annals of the Association of American Geographers, and the International Journal of GIS.  Outside of academia his professional experience has ranged from the hyper digital world of Data Science and Software Engineering for a large tech company in Silicon Valley to the insanely analog practice of being the sole proprietor of an antiquarian bookshop in Manhattan.

    "\n",
    "Dr. Daniel Larremore is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science and the BioFrontiers Institute at the University of Colorado Boulder. He is also an affiliate of the Department of Applied Mathematics at the University of Colorado Boulder, and is a member of the external faculty of the Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health. His research develops mathematical methods using novel combinations of networks, dynamical systems, and statistical inference to solve problems in two main areas: infectious disease epidemiology and computational social science. This work focuses on generative models for networks, the ongoing evolution and genomic epidemiology of the malaria parasite, and the origins of social inequalities in academic hiring and careers. Prior to joining the University of Colorado faculty, he was an Omidyar Fellow at the Santa Fe Institute 2015-2017 and a post-doctoral fellow at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health 2012-2015. He obtained his Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics from the University of Colorado Boulder in 2012, and holds an undergraduate degree in Chemical Engineering from Washington University in St. Louis."
