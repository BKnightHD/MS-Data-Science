    "Course Description\n",
    "\n",
    "This course provides a general introduction to the field of Data Science. It has been designed for aspiring data scientists, content experts who work with data scientists, or anyone interested in learning about what Data Science is and what it’s used for. Weekly topics include an overview of the skills needed to be a data scientist; the process and pitfalls involved in data science; and the practice of data science in the professional and academic world. This course is part of CU Boulder’s Master’s of Science in Data Science and was collaboratively designed by both academics and industry professionals to provide learners with an insider’s perspective on this exciting, evolving, and increasingly vital discipline.\n",

    "\n",
    "    Acquire, clean, wrangle, and manage data.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Be sensitive to ethical issues that are involved in dealing with data science applications arising in real world situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Clearly communicate the results of a data science analysis to a non-technical audience.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Use peer feedback, self-reflection and video analysis to improve collaboration skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Create reproducible statistical workflows.\n",

    "Drops, Tuition Refunds, and Withdrawals\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the MS-DS has flexible course start dates, all drops, tuition refunds, withdrawals and grades are handled at the individual course level. It is the student’s responsibility to monitor these deadlines. Coursera and CU Boulder are not responsible for notifying the students of these deadlines. For approximate session timelines, access the Boulder MS-DS Onboarding Course via the MS-DS degree homepage. To drop or withdraw from a course please complete the appropriate form on the CU Boulder Office of the Registrar website\n",

    "Drops and Refunds\n",
    "\n",
    "Each student has 14 days from a class start date or their enrollment date (whichever is later) to request a drop for 100% tuition refund. Students are only eligible to drop a course if they have not accessed the restricted content (timed proctored exam) or received a grade.  When a course is dropped under these conditions, it will not appear on the student’s record.\n",
    "Withdrawal\n",
    "\n",
    "Students who request to drop the course after the 14-day period and who have not accessed the timed proctored assessment may withdraw from the course but will not receive a refund. When a student withdraws from a course under these conditions, the student will receive a grade of W on their academic record. W grades have no bearing on the GPA and credit total.\n",

Class rosters are provided to the instructor with the student's legal name. We will gladly honor your request to address you by an alternate name or gender pronoun. Please advise us of this preference early in the semester so that we may make appropriate changes to my records. For more information, see the policies on classroom behavior\n",

Violations of the policy may include: plagiarism, cheating, fabrication, lying, bribery, threats, unauthorized access to academic materials, submitting the same or similar work in more than one course without permission from all course instructors involved, and aiding academic dishonesty. Students are specifically expected to turn in original work and cite portions created by other authors. If a student has doubts regarding what collaboration is permissible in the course, the student should consult the discussion forums or the course facilitator directly.\n",

    "CU Boulder is committed to fostering a positive and welcoming learning, working, and living environment. CU Boulder will not tolerate acts of sexual misconduct (including sexual harassment, exploitation, and assault), intimate partner violence (including dating or domestic violence), stalking, protected-class discrimination or harassment by members of our community. Individuals who believe they have been subject to misconduct or retaliatory actions for reporting a concern should contact the Office of Institutional Equity and Compliance (OIEC) at 303-492-2127 or cureport@colorado.edu.
