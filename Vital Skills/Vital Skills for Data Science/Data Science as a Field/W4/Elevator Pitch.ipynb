    "One key observation is the distribution of shooting incidents across the city's boroughs. By visualizing the data, we can see how these incidents are distributed among the boroughs, providing valuable information for understanding the local crime landscape.\n",

    "Additionally, I've examined how shooting incidents have evolved over the years. This analysis helps us track trends and changes in crime rates, which can be useful for policy makers and law enforcement agencies.\n",

    "Another angle I've explored is the daily and hourly patterns of shooting incidents. Understanding when these incidents are more likely to occur can inform resource allocation and public safety efforts.\n",
